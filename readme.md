# Flexbox Funhouse

Welcome to the Flexbox Funhouse! This is a fun, interactive way to learn CSS Flexbox.

## What is Flexbox?

Flexbox is a CSS layout module that makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

## What's in the Funhouse?

The Flexbox Funhouse is a simple webpage that demonstrates different ways to use Flexbox. Each section of the webpage shows a different Flexbox layout, and there's an explanation before each section that describes what the section demonstrates about Flexbox.

Here's what you'll find in the Funhouse:

1. **Jumping In:** A simple Flexbox layout with three boxes in a row.
2. **Level Up:** A Flexbox layout with three boxes stacked vertically.
3. **Master Level:** A responsive Flexbox layout that changes based on the screen size.
4. **Grandmaster Level:** A complex Flexbox layout with a 3x3 grid.
5. **Ultimate Level:** A navigation bar created with Flexbox.

## How to Use the Funhouse

To use the Flexbox Funhouse, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also view the source code in the `style.scss` file to see how the Flexbox layouts are created.

Remember, the key to mastering Flexbox (or anything else) is to practice, practice, practice. So keep playing around with these examples until you feel comfortable. And don't forget to have fun!
